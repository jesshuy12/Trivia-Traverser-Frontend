## About

Trivia Traverser is an obstacle game in which the player must navigate up, down, left, right to avoid incoming pillars. The player is a square object on a 2D area and pillars are rectangular. At anytime the player hits any side of a pillar the game is paused and the player is prompted with a coding question. If the player answers the question correct, the game will continue along with their score. If the player answers the question incorrect, the game is over and their score is final. There are a total of 10 questions that can be answered. If all 10 questions are answered correctly, the final turn after the last question is answered will be the last turn.
